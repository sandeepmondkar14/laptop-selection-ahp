# Laptop Selection Using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)

## Introduction
This project utilizes the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to identify the best laptop based on specific criteria chosen by the user. The AHP method helps in structuring and solving complex decisions by breaking them down into a hierarchy of more easily comprehended sub-problems.

## Project Structure
- `Laptop_Selection_AHP.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, data manipulation, and visualizations.
- `laptop_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis, containing specifications, scores, and prices for various laptops.
- `additional_data.xlsx`: An additional dataset providing further information, used for supported analysis.

## Data Overview
The main dataset (`laptop_dataset.csv`) includes details such as:
- **Processor Scores**
- **Graphics Scores**
- **Battery Life Scores**
- **Cost Scores**
- **Performance Ratings**
- **Customer Ratings**

## Setup
### Required Libraries
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install tk
```

## File Path
Ensure that the path to your CSV file is correct in the Jupyter Notebook. The default path is set to `C:/Users/Sandeep Mondkar/Downloads/laptop dataset.csv`. Update this path if your dataset is located elsewhere.

## Usage
- **Open**: Open the `Laptop_Selection_AHP.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
- **Run**: Execute the notebook cells sequentially to load data, perform analysis, and visualize results.
- **Customize**: Adjust the criteria rankings and dataset as needed to get tailored results.

## Conclusion
Based on initial impressions, I thought I would choose an Apple PC. However, data analysis led to a different recommendation.

This analysis was conducted using personal ranking criteria. Different criteria or weights will provide customized recommendations. The code can also adapt to different datasets, allowing for robust, data-driven decisions using AHP in various scenarios.
